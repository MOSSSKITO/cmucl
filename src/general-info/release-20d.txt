[Not yet released]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20d.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 20c release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:

  * Feature enhancements

  * Changes
    * ASDF2 updated to version 2.019.
    * Behavior of STRING-TO-OCTETS has changed.  This is an
      incompatible change from the previous version but should be more
      useful when a buffer is given which is not large enough to hold
      all the octets for the given string.  See docstring for more
      details.
    * The PowerPC port of CMUCL on Darwin (Mac OS X) has been revived
      and is up-to-date.  It will run on OSX 10.4 and 10.5.  However,
      only the Unicode build is supported.
    * Updated to Unicode 6.1.0.
      
  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    * CMUCL was not printing pathnames like (make-pathname :directory
      '(:absolute "tmp" "" "/")) correctly.  This is now printed using
      #P(...).

  * Bugfixes:
    * DECODE-FLOAT was not correctly declared and could not be
      compiled to handle double-double-floats.
    * The source distribution now includes the scripts from the bin
      directory, which was previously missing.
    * The stack needs to be 16-byte aligned on Darwin.
    * ldb no longer prints prompts forever when EOF is reached.

  * Trac Tickets:
    * #50: Print/read error with make-pathname.
    * #53: UTF-8 in core.
    * #52: UNICODE-COMPLETE-NAME misses a completion.
    * #55: blocked signals.

  * Other changes:
    * The layout of the cmucl directories has been changed.
    * On darwin/x86, gcc-4.2 is explicitly used in case Xcode 4 is
      installed.  CMUCL doesn't run correctly when built with gcc/llvm
      in Xcode 4.

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20c; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
