========================== C M U C L  21 c =============================

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 21c.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and bug
fixes from the 21a release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a
source-level debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor
implemented in Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of
volunteers collaborating over the Internet, and is mostly in the
public domain.
