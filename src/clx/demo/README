A brief description of the files in this directory, as best I (FMG) can figure.

bezier.lisp: An example of how to define an extension.  As far as I know, there's no bezier
extension in most X servers, so this won't do much.

beziertest.lisp: An example of how to invoke the bezier extension.

Both the above files are obsolete.

clclock.lisp: Display a clock using Roman numerals.  Works.

clipboard.lisp: Shows how to manage cut-and-paste (the X clipboard).  Works.

clx-demos.lisp: Some old graphics demos.  Works.  Many of them have been updated in the cmucl
src/contrib/demos directory.

gl-test.lisp: A test and demonstration of the GL interface.  Seems to mostly work on my system.

hello.lisp: A hello-world X program that gives a kind of skeleton for X programs.  Works.

mandel.lisp: A Mandelbrot set generator that I couldn't get to work, even by hacking quite a
bit on it.  There are some obvious problems in the code that I tried fixing and some less
obvious ones that I couldn't fix.  The code here is as I originally found it.

menu.lisp: An old menu demonstration program.  Works.

zoid.lisp: Another program for interfacing with extensions.  Again this extension (the "zoid
extension") doesn't exist in any X server I know of.  This is another obsolete file.
