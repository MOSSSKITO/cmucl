Neither of these tests works correctly.

image.lisp: Draws images on your screen.  Doesn't do what it says it will do, but that's
probably because of various assumptions it makes that aren't true.

trapezoid.lisp: Doesn't compile and wouldn't work if it did because of lack of the extension
that implements the "poly-fill-trapezoids" functions.
